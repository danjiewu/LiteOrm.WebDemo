### Recommended Reading Path

1. New to LiteOrm: start with [Overview](./getting-started/overview.md) and [Installation](./getting-started/installation.md) in Getting Started.
2. Configuration and a first app: pick [Base Only](./getting-started/first-example.md), [Manual (No DI)](./getting-started/first-example-manual.md), or [DI Extension](./getting-started/first-example-di.md) depending on your project.
3. About to adopt it in a real project: continue through Core Usage to build up the full picture of entities, queries, writes and associations.
4. Integrating via `LiteOrm.DependencyInjection` (Autofac, AOP): read the [Config Reference](./reference/configuration-reference.md) first, then the transactions, logging and service authorization topics in DI Extension.
5. Sharding, performance or dialect differences: continue with Advanced Topics.
6. Extending the framework itself: see Extensibility.
7. Landing a concrete business scenario (tenant isolation, data permissions, soft delete and archiving, auditing, sensitive field encryption, concurrency and read/write splitting): see Use Cases — every topic ships a requirement description plus copy-paste-ready code.
8. Need to confirm a configuration key, an interface name or a term: go straight to Reference.
